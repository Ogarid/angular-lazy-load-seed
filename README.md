A seed to create an AngularJS project that lazy-loads modules with ocLazyLoad and ui.router

There is just one main folder called 'js' where there are all folders you need to run the project.
    
vendor

Here we have all third party libraries that we maybe would need for our project

    * [angularJS]
    * [requireJS]

And I set here also [bootstrap3] and [jQuery]. These are not necessary, but I use to need them in my projects.
